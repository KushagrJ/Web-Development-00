 * In simple terms, the Internet is a global network of networks, i.e. a bunch
   of connected devices. These devices can be of various types, such as
   desktops, laptops, smartphones, refrigerators, wristwatches, etc.
 * The interconnected devices communicate with each other via the TCP/IP.

 * It is impractical to connect every device to every other device directly,
   thus the Internet uses routing, where there are devices having the specific
   job of connecting other devices.
 * The basic principle behind routing in the Internet is that in the early days
   of telephony, companies used manual telephone switchboards, and switchboard
   operators connected calls by inserting a pair of phone plugs into the
   appropriate jacks.

 * The World Wide Web, or the Web, is an information system where documents and
   other resources are available over the Internet.
 * Servers and resources on the Web are identified and located through URLs, and
   the information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using the HTTP,
   which is a protocol, or a standardised set of rules, for how a form of
   communication should work.

 * A web server is a computer software and the underlying hardware that accepts
   requests via the HTTP.
   A user agent, commonly a web browser, initiates communication by making a
   request for a web page or other resource using the HTTP, and the server
   responds with the content of that resource or an error message.
